This Python script allows users to input a paragraph and replace predefined "bad" words with suitable alternatives from a list. It highlights bad words in red and their replacements in green. The list of words to be replaced is loaded from a text file in bad_word,good_word format. This tool is useful for sanitizing text and ensuring inappropriate words are replaced consistently.

Key features:
* Tokenizes and processes user input text.
* Highlights bad words in red and replacements in green (console-dependent).
* Loads word replacements from a configurable file.
